## Deployment Overview

Mordoc generates static HTML files that can be hosted anywhere:

- **Traditional hosting**: Shared hosting, VPS, dedicated servers
- **CDN platforms**: Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS CloudFront

Because Mordoc generates standard static HTML, you're not locked into any specific platform. Choose based on your needs, budget, and existing infrastructure.
