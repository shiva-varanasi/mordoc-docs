description: Build elegant and highly usable documentation websites using Mordoc.
---

Mordoc is a documentation framework built on [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/), that transforms your content into clean, elegant, and highly usable documentation websites.

You write content using simple, easy-to-learn syntax, and Mordoc takes care of the rest by handling navigation, layouts, styling, and structure, turning your content into a fully-functional documentation site that feels professional out of the box.

# Why Mordoc?

There are plenty of great documentation tools out there, and many of them already do an excellent job. So… why another one?

Many documentation tools offer rich content writing experiences, but they often come bundled with hosted platforms, proprietary editors, or rigid workflows. Others provide powerful foundations, but expect teams to assemble everything themselves. Every organization is different, and these approaches do not always fit.

Mordoc takes a different approach. It provides an open source documentation framework that allows teams to maintain content as code and deploy it to any infrastructure they choose. With all documentation components built in, content writers can start writing immediately using simple, easy-to-learn syntax.

{% callout type="note" title="Takeaway" %}
You do what you do best, writing content, and let Mordoc take care of the rest.
{% /callout %}

Here’s what that looks like in practice.

## Content‑first, component‑driven

Mordoc ships with all documentation components built in, so there is nothing to assemble before you start writing. Once installed, those components can be reused everywhere through clear, readable syntax.

That means:

* Content writers focus on structure and clarity, not implementation details
* Rich components like cards, callouts, codeblocks, tables, etc are easy to use and hard to misuse
* Documentation stays consistent across pages and contributors

The syntax is intentionally limited and predictable. It is designed to be easy to learn, easy to read, and easy to maintain over time.

## Content as code

Mordoc treats content as code without forcing authors to think like developers.

Because your content lives in files:

* Changes are tracked and reviewable
* Version history is explicit
* Collaboration scales naturally with your team

You get the benefits of modern change management while keeping the writing experience lightweight and focused.

## No vendor lock‑in

Your documentation belongs to you.

* Host it anywhere
* Deploy on any infrastructure
* Move away anytime without rewriting content

Mordoc generates documentation websites. It doesn’t trap your content inside a platform.

## Built for collaboration

Mordoc is designed so that:

* Content creators focus on writing and structure
* Developers focus on system design and infrastructure (only when needed)

This separation of concerns makes documentation easier to scale and easier to maintain.

## Open source by design

Mordoc is open source and transparent.

* No black boxes
* No hidden behavior
* Community‑driven improvements

You can inspect it, extend it, and adapt it to your needs.
