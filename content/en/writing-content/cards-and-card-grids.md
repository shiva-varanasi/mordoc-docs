title: Cards and Card Grids
description: Create visual groups of links with cards and card grids.
---

Cards are useful when you want to guide readers toward a few related pages or choices.

A card is a small content block. A card grid arranges multiple cards together.

Use cards when a reader needs to choose where to go next. For example, a homepage might link to the most important sections of a site.

## Add a card grid

Start with a `cardGrid`:

```markdown
{% cardGrid cols="3" %}
{% /cardGrid %}
```

The `cols` value controls how many columns the grid tries to show on wide screens. Common values are `2` and `3`. Mordoc will still adapt the layout on smaller screens.

## Card grid attributes

{% table %}
* Attribute
* Description
* Values
* Required
---
* `cols`
* Preferred number of columns on wide screens
* `1`-`4` (default `3`)
* Optional
{% /table %}

## Add cards inside the grid

Each card needs a `title`:

```markdown
{% cardGrid cols="2" %}
{% card title="Install" path="/guides/install" %}
Install the product and check that it runs.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Configure" path="/guides/configure" %}
Adjust settings for your project.
{% /card %}
{% /cardGrid %}
```

The `title` field is required. Use `path` when the card should link somewhere. The other card fields are optional.

## Choose a card style

Mordoc supports a few card styles:

* A plain card, with just a title, a path, and body text
* A card with a `tag`, for a short badge like `New` or `Start here`
* A card with an `icon`, for a small icon next to the title
* A card with an `image`, for a larger image above the title

## Simple cards

Use a plain card when the title and a short sentence are enough to help the reader decide.

```markdown
{% cardGrid cols="2" %}
{% card title="Build and Deploy" path="/publishing/build-your-site" %}
Generate a static site and deploy it to any hosting platform in minutes.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Preview Before Publishing" path="/publishing/preview-before-publishing" %}
See exactly how your site looks before it goes live — no surprises.
{% /card %}
{% /cardGrid %}
```

**How it renders**

{% cardGrid cols="2" %}
{% card title="Build and Deploy" path="/publishing/build-your-site" %}
Generate a static site and deploy it to any hosting platform in minutes.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Preview Before Publishing" path="/publishing/preview-before-publishing" %}
See exactly how your site looks before it goes live — no surprises.
{% /card %}
{% /cardGrid %}

## Simple cards with badge

Use `tag` for short labels like `New`, `Start here`, or `Recommended`. Use tags sparingly. If every card has a tag, the tags stop feeling helpful.

```markdown
{% cardGrid cols="2" %}
{% card title="Quickstart" path="/getting-started/create-project" tag="Start here" %}
Begin with the fastest path through the docs.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Callouts" path="/writing-content/callouts" tag="New" %}
Highlight notes, tips, warnings, and important messages in Mordoc pages.
{% /card %}
{% /cardGrid %}
```

**How it renders**

{% cardGrid cols="2" %}
{% card title="Quickstart" path="/getting-started/create-project" tag="Start here" %}
Begin with the fastest path through the docs.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Callouts" path="/writing-content/callouts" tag="New" %}
Highlight notes, tips, warnings, and important messages in Mordoc pages.
{% /card %}
{% /cardGrid %}

## Cards with icon

Add `icon` to show a small icon next to the title. `icon` renders in a small square box without cropping, so a square icon, ideally an SVG, fits best.

```markdown
{% cardGrid cols="3" %}
{% card title="Getting Started" path="/getting-started/create-project" icon="/icons/card-icons/getting-started.svg" %}
Create your first project, run it locally, and learn how Mordoc works from the ground up.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Writing Content" path="/writing-content/markdown-basics" icon="/icons/card-icons/writing.svg" %}
Markdown basics, callouts, tables, cards, landing pages, and everything in between.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Configuration" path="/configuration/site-configuration" icon="/icons/card-icons/configuration.svg" %}
Tailor your site with navigation, branding, themes, variables, and multi-language support.
{% /card %}
{% /cardGrid %}
```

**How it renders**

{% cardGrid cols="3" %}
{% card title="Getting Started" path="/getting-started/create-project" icon="/icons/card-icons/getting-started.svg" %}
Create your first project, run it locally, and learn how Mordoc works from the ground up.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Writing Content" path="/writing-content/markdown-basics" icon="/icons/card-icons/writing.svg" %}
Markdown basics, callouts, tables, cards, landing pages, and everything in between.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Configuration" path="/configuration/site-configuration" icon="/icons/card-icons/configuration.svg" %}
Tailor your site with navigation, branding, themes, variables, and multi-language support.
{% /card %}
{% /cardGrid %}

## Cards with image

Add `image` to show a larger image above the title.

```markdown
{% cardGrid cols="3" %}
{% card title="Český Krumlov" image="/images/content-images/cesky-krumlov.jpg" %}
A fairy-tale town in South Bohemia, wrapped by a bend in the Vltava.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Iceland" image="/images/content-images/iceland.jpg" %}
Waterfalls, glaciers, and black sand beaches around every bend.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Reine" image="/images/content-images/reine.jpg" %}
A fishing village tucked beneath the peaks of the Lofoten Islands.
{% /card %}
{% /cardGrid %}
```

**How it renders**

{% cardGrid cols="3" %}
{% card title="Český Krumlov" image="/images/content-images/cesky-krumlov.jpg" %}
A fairy-tale town in South Bohemia, wrapped by a bend in the Vltava.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Iceland" image="/images/content-images/iceland.jpg" %}
Waterfalls, glaciers, and black sand beaches around every bend.
{% /card %}
{% card title="Reine" image="/images/content-images/reine.jpg" %}
A fishing village tucked beneath the peaks of the Lofoten Islands.
{% /card %}
{% /cardGrid %}

{% callout type="tip" title="Match the expected aspect ratio" %}
`image` renders in a fixed 16:9 box and is cropped to fill it, so a 16:9 source image (for example 800x450 or 1200x675) avoids losing its edges.
{% /callout %}

## Keep card text short

Card text should help readers choose. One short sentence is usually enough.

## Card attributes

{% table %}
* Attribute
* Description
* Values
* Required
---
* `title`
* The card heading
* Any text
* Required
---
* `path`
* The page or URL the whole card links to
* A path or URL
* Optional
---
* `icon`
* A small icon shown next to the title. Ignored if `image` is set
* Icon path
* Optional
---
* `image`
* A larger image shown above the title
* Image path
* Optional
